## Reflecting on classes not yet loaded

In most cases, creating reflections using a built-in `SourceLocator` or the `ReflectionClass::createFromName()` 
technique doesn't attempt to load code. This means if a class has not already been declared, you can safely assume that
Better Reflection won't load the class.

Note that if the class is *already* loaded, then this Better Reflection does not then *unload* that class - this is not 
currently possible in PHP.

## Reflecting on things within a string

See [Loading a class from a string](https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection/tree/master/docs/usage.md#Loading-a-class-from-a-string)

## Analysing types from DocBlocks

See [types documentation](https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection/tree/master/docs/types.md)

## AST extraction from Reflections

See [AST extraction documentation](https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection/tree/master/docs/ast-extraction.md)

## PHP 7 Parameter Type Declarations and Return Type Declarations

These act in the same way as the core reflection API, except they return a 
`\Roave\BetterReflection\Reflection\ReflectionType` instance (which does not extend `\ReflectionType`).

```
$reflectionType = $parameterInfo->getType();
```

However, Better Reflection also gives the ability to change, and remove type declarations. Removing these types might 
be useful if you want to make code written for PHP 7 work in PHP 5 for example, or setting new types to do the 
opposite. For example, you might want to set the PHP 7 return type declaration to that defined in the PHP DocBlock.

```
// Change a function to ensure it returns an integer
$functionInfo->setReturnType('int');

// If there is only one type defined in the DocBlock, set it as the return type
$returnTypes = $functionInfo->getDocBlockReturnTypes();
if (count($returnTypes) === 1) {
    $functionInfo->setReturnType((string) $returnTypes[0]);
}

// Remove the return type declaration
$functionInfo->removeReturnType();
```

You can do similar things with parameter types also:

```
$parameterInfo->setType('int');
$parameterInfo->removeType();
```
